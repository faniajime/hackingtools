# Hacking-tools
A set of hacking tools for preforming different types of attacks.

- [Decoder](/decoder.py)

  This tool helps you compare a hash with a given salt with a text given in txt.
  It mutates the words in normal ways people modify their passwords, for example, adding numbers, switching casing, etc.
  This allows you to crack a password when you know someone loves certain book or text.
  
- [Wordlist Generator](/wordlist_generator.py)

  This generates wordlists to try as passwords when preforming brute force attacks.
  This is ideal when you know a person loves certain books, or when you have gathered information from them.
